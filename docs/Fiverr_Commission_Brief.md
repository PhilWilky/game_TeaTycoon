## Why This Project?

I'm building an indie management sim game (Tea Tycoon) set in a vintage tea shop. The game is about managing a tea business - buying supplies, serving customers, growing your reputation.

The current UI is functional but uses placeholder graphics. Your art will be the visual identity players see throughout the entire game - it's crucial to the game's feel and polish.

This is a portfolio piece opportunity for game UI design and could lead to additional work as the game expands (more menus, seasonal themes, etc.).

---

## Selection Criteria

**What I'm Looking For:**

- Strong portfolio showing UI/game assets
- Experience with 9-patch/9-slice if possible
- Understanding of scalable game UI design
- Good communication and responsiveness
- Attention to detail

**To Apply, Please Include:**

1. Link to your portfolio
2. Relevant past game UI work (if any)
3. Your estimated timeline
4. Your price for the full package
5. Confirmation you can provide source files
6. Any questions or clarification needed

---

## Example Use Cases

**These assets will be used to build:**

- Inventory management screens
- Shop front during business hours
- Customer queue display
- Stats/reports panels
- Main menu and settings
- Tutorial overlays

**Single asset = multiple uses**
Example: The ornate frame will wrap around ~20+ different panels throughout the game.
