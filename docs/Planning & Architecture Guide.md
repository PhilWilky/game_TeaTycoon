## üö® URGENT fixes üö®

- **Fresh milk in Inventory** - Does not spoil in the GUI after the day ends, this should be changed when the phase is changed to next "morning prep" phase.
- **Daily reports** - Should show how much was spend and how much stock was spoiled, this should also be added to the cumulative stats.
