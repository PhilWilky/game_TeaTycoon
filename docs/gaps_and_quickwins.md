# Tea Shop Tycoon â€“ Gaps, Risks & Quick Wins

## ðŸš§ Gaps & Risks to Watch

- **Save/Load missing** â†’ Blocks playtesting + balance persistence
- **Config migration** (hard-coded â†’ JSON) â†’ Risk of data drift across systems
- **Balance surface area** grows fast once staff/locations/equipment land
- **Single Source of Truth** not formalized (central DataRegistry/GameState)
- **Coupling risks** between UI and managers (ensure signal-first comms)
- **Versioning** for future save compatibility not defined
- **Testability** (seeded RNG + repro harness) not formalized

5. **Signal hygiene pass**
   - Remove cross-pulling; enforce event-driven updates
